# Solar-Power-Performance-Analysis
This project analyzes a solar power generation dataset collected from Kaggle which consists of data between October 1 and December 25, 2022, at 5-minute intervals. It explores how environmental factors like temperature and humidity influence power output, using Excel for cleaning, Python for data exploration and subplots, and Power BI for dashboard visualization.

**Dataset Description**
DatetimeIndex: Timestamp of each measurement 
Ua (V): Voltage generated by the photovoltaic system 
Ia (A): Current generated by the photovoltaic system 
P (kW): Power output of the system 
TEMP (°C): Ambient temperature 
H (%): Relative humidity 

**Tools**
- Excel: Data cleaning and formatting  
- Python (Matplotlib, Pandas): Data exploration and subplots  
- Power BI: Interactive dashboard for performance monitoring

**Insights**
- December showed higher power output than October and November due to cooler temperature and higher irradiance.
- Temperature strongly impacted **voltage**, while humidity affected **current**.
- Regular cleaning and monitoringis recommended to minimize efficiency loss.
